1.  Schedule_interval with internal_update method in gameObject class
    internal_update should include update() to be overridden by sub-class.
    internal_update should allow rot_speed and hspeed, vspeed, speed, etc.
    ** Better way - use list_class and list_instance and list_batch
2. Handle collision in a novel way
3. Investigate default draw method. Allow for multiple images (already possible - every sprite loaded gets drawn).
4. Use a batch_list internally for drawing.
5. Convert pygame rect, circle, line classes.
6. Seperate resource loading, level loading (with *similar multiple instance* creation helper method).
7. Allow timers.
8. Handle proper deletion.
9. Keep proper track of handlers on level reload.
